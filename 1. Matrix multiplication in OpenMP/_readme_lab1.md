## Used hardware
## Used software

### Problem
```txt
Input:
A (M,N)
B (N,M)
Task: 
1 .Implement Matrix Multiplication:
1.1) Using SPMD Pattern
1.2) Using OpenMP loop directives with different schedule (type[, chunk]) configurations.
2. Do speedup tests:
2.1) with different amount of data
2.2) with different number of threads
3. Write a report that should include: task definition, brief theory, implementation description, test results (tables, graphicsâ€¦)

```
